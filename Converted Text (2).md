Data visualization help in presenting and visualizing data that is generally difficult or time-consuming from raw-data format to easily interpretable formats using simple diagrams. In the realm of bioinformatics and computational biology, especially in cancer studies present everywhere now days visualization of data is an important tool for explaining complex biological activities, looking for patterns and making decisions wisely also keeps a place to discover new treatments or drugs. Personalized cancer vaccine is being worked on recently by the researchers.

The most commonly used tasks in data visualization within the framework of cancer research are biomarker identification. Biomarkers are biological molecules that can be used to identify the existence, status or change of a disease. Researchers can also take in massive datasets that contain genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic information mapping it over and then visualize trends/patterns and maybe even correlate data with cancer progression or development. One might create a scatter plot that contrasts the expression levels of genes in cancerous against non-cancerous cells for example and identify genes which are differentially expressed in tumors.

Predictive Models Two other significant application areas of data visualization come in the form of modeling and prediction. Scientists use this visualization to model associations of different variables and predict the results — occurrence of a disease (cancer recurrence) or inefficacy of a treatment. An example is in generating survival plots, where events (e.g., death or disease progression) are time-to-event endpoints that can be plotted against groups of patients, to determine factors influencing prognosis.

Using ggplot2 in R, A definitive tool that can draw multiple aesthetically pleasant and informative graphics is the ggplot2 library. With the help of this library, researchers can visualize complicated data in the form of boxplots, line charts, column charts, bubble charts and pie charts thus making data concise. They are critical to the process of identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in-the-data that can lead to more research / innovation for cancer treatment. Base R has limited plotting capabilities and on complex cancer datasets such these might not suffice.

It also has numerous libraries which can be installed and used whenever required during the data analysis. These libraries also allow you to use statistical tests which can suggest the type of visualization. Users prefer RStudio — an integrated development environment for R because of a beautiful UI and coding environment that greatly enhances user experience.

Data visualization provides both an analytical function and the means of communicating research findings to a wider audience. Sophisticated visualizations can be important in breaking down complex concepts that would otherwise be non-experts but are learning, easy to understand as well as aiding collaboration and general public understanding of cancer research. For instance, you may deploy interactive dashboards to provide visually aesthetical and interactive exhibits of research findings — enabling individuals to navigate through data on their own.
